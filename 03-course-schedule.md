## Course Schedule (Tentative):
### Spring Training (mid-March through end-of-spring-semester)

ESIIL instructors will meet weekly with each team to answer questions and check-in on interns' progress. We will bring all of the teams together to meet as a large group throughout the spring and summer semesters. 

Spring training will include the following **Big Ideas:**
* Building your brand with **GitHub Pages**
* Using **GitHub** for collaborative data science
* **Open** and **reproducible** science with **Python**
* **Earth and Environmental Data Science** with **Python**
    * Tabular and **time-series** data
    * **Vector** spatial data
    * **Raster** spatial data

### Summer Group Projects 

Starting in the summer semester (**early-June**), group projects will begin. From here through the end of the internship (**first week of August**), teams will begin checking-in multiple times per week for regular progress reports, and help sessions for group projects. Each team will be responsible for **designing their own project** to apply the EDS skills learned during the Spring Training. Each team will present their group project during a **final presentation** and in written form through a **project blog post** during the final week of the internship. We will post your presentations and blogs to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@earthlabcuboulder458/featured" target="_blank">**YouTube**</a> channel and other **social media**. We will also discuss **Digital Object Identifiers** (DOI) and other ways to make your work findable and citable.
